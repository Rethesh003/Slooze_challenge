## üßæ Analysis Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Demand Forecasting
- Analyzed historical sales data to identify **monthly trends**.
- Applied **3-month moving average** to smooth sales variations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ABC Analysis
- Categorized inventory into **A, B, C** classes:
  - **A:** High value (Top 70%)
  - **B:** Medium value (Next 20%)
  - **C:** Low value (Bottom 10%)
- Helps prioritize stock control and order frequency.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ EOQ & Reorder Point
- Calculated **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** to balance ordering and holding costs.
- Determined **Reorder Points** using lead times and safety stock formula.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lead Time Analysis
- Compared **Purchase Order Date** and **Receiving Date** to compute average lead times.
- Identified vendors with the longest delays.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Top Product Analysis
- Highlighted top-selling products by sales revenue.
- Compared **EOQ values** for high-value items.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonal Trends
- Forecasted sales per product/store.
- Identified **seasonal peaks** (high-demand months).
